	<p>My name is Thao Tran and I come from Vietnam. I have stayed in the United State for 5 years.</p>
	<p>I come from a beautiful and peaceful hometown called Dalat. It is very famous for the tourist because it has four seasons day. In addition, its unique weather also provide good conditions for growing flowers. As the result, Dalat is also called as "City of Thousand flowers". </p>
